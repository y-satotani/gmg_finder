@article{Iwashita2013,
abstract = {Many important problems of graph enumeration and indexing can be solved by frontier-based methods, which construct ZDDs in a breadth-first manner from the top to the bottom. We present new techniques toward an efficient framework to deal with the frontier-based methods. Ad hoc parts of the algorithm are encapsulated using the recursive specifications that represent properties to be compiled into a ZDD. In this framework, we can apply the ZDD node deletion rule on the fly, while conventional methods does not take it into account. Operations on the recursive specifications, which allow us to combine multiple properties without constructing ZDD structure for each property, are also introduced. These techniques are applicable to existing frontier-based methods and accelerates even Knuth's sophisticated path enumeration algorithm doubly.},

@article{Kawahara,
abstract = {For the subgraph enumeration problem, there have been proposed very efficient algorithms whose time complexities are far less than the number of subgraphs. Although the number of subgraphs can increase exponentially with the graph size, they exploit compressed representations to maintain enumer-ated subgraphs compactly so as to reduce the time complexity. However, they are designed for enumerating a specific type of subgraphs only, e.g., paths or trees. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm framework, called frontier-based search, which generalizes these specific algorithms without losing their efficiency. We believe that our frontier-based search will be used to resolve various practical problems that include complicated subgraph enumeration.},

@article{Miller2005,
abstract = {The degree/diameter problem is to determine the largest graphs or digraphs of given maximum degree and given diameter. General upper bounds - called Moore bounds - for the order of such graphs and digraphs are attainable only for certain special graphs and digraphs. Finding better (tighter) upper bounds for the maxi- mum possible number of vertices, given the other two parameters, and thus attack- ing the degree/diameter problem `from above', remains a largely unexplored area. Constructions producing large graphs and digraphs of given degree and diameter represent a way of attacking the degree/diameter problem `from below'. This sur- vey aims to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art of the degree/diameter problem. We focus mainly on the above two streams of research. However, we could not resist mentioning also results on various related problems. These include considering Moore-like bounds for special types of graphs and digraphs, such as vertex-transitive, Cayley, planar, bipartite, and many others, on the one hand, and related properties such as connectivity, regularity, and surface embeddability, on the other hand.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators(1-4), Josephson junction arrays(5,6), excitable media(7), neural networks(8-10), spatial games(11), genetic control networks(12) and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
